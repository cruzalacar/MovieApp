    * all buttons work

    * comboboxes contain some items
    * submit button (it will show a messagebox and set the boxes to default)

* **ReadReviewPage**
    * design
    * combobox containing same movie titles as in the WRP

### What needs to be done ###

* **WriteReviewPage**
     * need to take all inputted info and write it to document

* **ReadReviewPage**
     * when a movie is selected, the first review will be retrieved from a document an
       display in the textblock.
     * back and next button will display the reviews one at a time
